# ASSIGNMENT : Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage
# ⚽ Option 2: Re-Identification in single feed

This project implements a robust player re-identification system using deep learning and computer vision. It focuses on **intra-camera re-identification**, ensuring that each player maintains a consistent ID across all frames of a single video.


## 📌 Task Overview

- **Objective:** Re-identify and consistently track soccer players within a broadcast or tacticam video.
- **Approach:** Combine YOLOv8 for player detection, OSNet for appearance embeddings, and DeepSORT for ID tracking.


## 🧠 Pipeline Overview

Video Input → YOLOv11 Detection → OSNet Embedding → DeepSORT Tracking → Output Video with IDs


### ✔ Components:

| Module      | Function                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `detect.py` | Extracts detections + re-ID embeddings (pickled) |
| `main.py`   | Generates video with bounding boxes + player IDs |
| `track.py`  | Initializes DeepSORT tracker                     |
| `utils.py`  | Embedding model (Torchreid) and helper functions |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone and Prepare Environment

git clone ________
cd option2-single-camera


### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


> ℹ️ If using Anaconda:

conda create -n player-reid python=3.9
conda activate player-reid
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3️⃣ Torchreid Compatibility Fix (if needed)

pip uninstall torchreid
pip install git+https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid.git


## ▶️ Run the Project
### Generate Output Video with Re-ID

python main.py
> ✅ Output video will be saved as `output.mp4`.


## 📦 Key Dependencies
